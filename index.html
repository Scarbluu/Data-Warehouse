                        What is Data Warehouse?
                    </span></h1>
                    <p class="about__description">A Data Warehouse is separate from DBMS, it stores a huge amount of data, which is typically 
                    collected from multiple heterogeneous sources like files, DBMS, etc. The goal is to produce statistical results that may help in decision makings.
                    In layman terms, a data warehouse would mean a huge repository of organized and potentially useful data. This is what Bill Inmon, 
                    according to him, a data warehouse is a clear, integrated representation of a non-volatile collection of both historical 
                    and current data. Analysis of this data helps organizations take informed decisions.</p>

                        <p class="services__description">The data in a warehouse is of the non-volatile type which ensures that your previous data is 
                not lost as new data is updated which separates them for operational databases which are subject to frequent changes.</p>
                <h3 class="services__title" style="color:#4686c8;">Time Variant</h3>
                        <p class="services__description">What’s the significance of data without a time stamp? Data uploaded into a warehouse can be identified with a certain timeline making 
                  it a multidimensional historical view whenever you access data.</p>
                        <h3 class="services__title" style="color:#4686c8;">No Additional Controls</h3>
                        <p class="services__description">As the warehouse is maintained separate and has a separate storage from the operational databases, it doesn’t require any concurrency controls, 
                  tweaks in processing, recovery mechanisms.</p>

                        <p class="contact__description">As we have seen that the size of the open database has grown approximately double its magnitude in the last few years, 
                        it shows significant value. As the size of the databases grow, the estimates of what constitutes a very large database continues to grow. 
                        As the number of users increases, the size of the data warehouse also increases. With the growth of the Internet, there is a requirement of users to access data online. 
                        Hence the future shape of data warehouse will be very different from what is being created today.</p>
